Tuning parameters
=================

pyDML package also provides functions for tuning parameters of distance metric algorithms using cross validation. Different scores can be used, from the k-Nearest Neighbors score, for any k, to any of the keys defined in the metadata of the distance metric learning algorithm. See the `tune <dml.html#module-dml.tune>`_ module and the `tune <dml.html#dml.tune.tune>`_ and `tune_knn <dml.html#dml.tune.tune_knn>`_ functions.
