Maximally Collapsing Metric Learning (MCML)
===========================================

An information-theory based distance metric learning algorithm. It obtains a metric that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the ideal distribution where every points in the same class collapse into a single point, and different class points are infinitely far away.
