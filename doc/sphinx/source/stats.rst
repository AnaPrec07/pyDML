=====

The distance metric learning algorithms in pyDML are being evaluated in several datasets. The results of these experiments are available in the `pyDML-Stats <https://github.com/jlsuarezdiaz/pyDML-Stats>`_ repository. In this webpage, the algorithms are tested with some distance-based classifiers in several different situations.
