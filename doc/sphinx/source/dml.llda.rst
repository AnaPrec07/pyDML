Local Linear Discriminant Analysis
==================================

A local version of `LDA <dml.lda.html>`_. This algorithm performs with the same strategy as LDA, but it makes use of an affinity matrix, that is, a sparse matrix that measures the closeness between the samples, and that defines the local structure to be learned.

Watch the full LLDA documentation `here <dml.html#module-dml.llda>`_.
